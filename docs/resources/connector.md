### Required

- `name` (String) The connector display name.
- `network_item_id` (String) The id of the network with which this connector is associated.
- `network_item_type` (String) The type of network item of the connector. Supported values are `HOST` and `NETWORK`.
- `vpn_region_id` (String) The id of the region where the connector will be deployed.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `ip_v4_address` (String) The IPV4 address of the connector.

## Import

A connector can be imported using the connector ID, which can be fetched directly from the API.

```
terraform import openvpncloud_connector.connector <connector-uuid>
```

~> NOTE: If the Terraform resource settings are different from the imported connector, the next time you run `terraform apply` the provider will attempt to delete and recreate the connector, which will require you to re-configure the instance manually.
